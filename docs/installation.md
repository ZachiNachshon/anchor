1. Build a binary

   ```bash

   ```
   
1. Copy the binary to the bin folder in use

   ```bash
   # Make sure '${HOME}/.local/bin' exists in PATH or sourced on every new session
   cp anchor ${HOME}/.local/bin
   
   # Alternatively, copy directly to /usr/local/bin
   cp anchor /usr/local/bin
   ```
