**Anchor** is a lightweight CLI tool that grants the **dynamic marketplace** experience for local / CI environment by connecting to single/multiple remote repositories, each represents a different marketplace of domain, each with its own executable actions.

Every marketplace repository allows Anchor to **centralize and organize** a set of domain items into their own categories, every domain containing a list of executable single **action** and/or grouped actions (**workflows**) per item in a coherent, visible and easy-to-use approach. 

**Anchor** connects to remote git repositories containing an opinionated structure that allows it to understand what is available, exposing pre-defined **categories** as a dynamicly created CLI commands with their underlying domain items as **actions / workflows (actions-sets)** using an **interactive** selector enriched with **documentation** or in a **non-interactive** mode via direct CLI command.

| :heavy_exclamation_mark: WARNING |
| :--------------------------------------- |
| Anchor is still in **alpha stage**, breaking changes might occur, use it with caution ! |

<br>

<h2 id="requirements">üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Requirements</h2>

- A Unix-like operating system: macOS, Linux
- `git` (recommended v2.30.0 or higher)

<br>

<h2 id="quickstart">‚ö°Ô∏è QuickStart</h2>

The fastest way (for `macOS` and `Linux`) to install `anchor` is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ZachiNachshon/tap/anchor
```

Alternatively, tap into the formula to have brew search capabilities on that tap formulas:

```bash
# Tap
brew tap ZachiNachshon/tap

# Install
brew install anchor
```

For additional installation methods [read here](docs/installation.md).

<h3 id="why-creating-anchor">‚õµ Why Creating <code>Anchor</code>?</h3>

1. I believe that local environment management should be a *smooth sailing* - documented process with minimum context switches for *running scripts / installing applications / orchestrate installations / do whatever you require* on it
1. Allowing to compose different actions from multiple channels (shell scripts, CLI utilities etc..) into a coherent well documented workflow with rollback procedure
1. Having an action / workflow execution plan explained in plain english and managed via a central versioned controlled remote repository that can be shared with others to use
1. Using an agnostic client that doesn't change, rather, changes are reflected based on remote marketplace state

This section contains a running `anchor` CLI live running demo and an instructions section for interacting with a remote playground marketplace.

</details>

<h4 id="playground">Playground</h4>

Take `anchor` for a spin using the following steps, connect to a remote playground repository and check the different use-cases it might be used for:

1. Register to a remote playground marketplace and set it as the default config context:

   ```bash
   anchor config set-context-entry playground \
    --repository.remote.url=git@github.com:ZachiNachshon/anchorfiles-playground.git \
    --set-current-context
   ```

1. Type `anchor` to print all available playground CLI commands

1. Check which items are available under the `dummy-ops` command:

   ```bash
   anchor dummy-ops status
   ```
   
1. Select the `dummy-ops` command to interact with interactively:

   ```bash
   # Select a command item via an interactive prompter/search menu and try an action/workflow
   anchor dummy-ops select
   ```

1. Run an action directly from the playground non-interactively:

   ```bash
   anchor dummy-ops run greeter --action=hello-world
   ```

1. Run workflows directly from the playground non-interactively:

   ```bash
   # without output
   anchor dummy-ops run greeter-silent --workflow=good-manners-simulation
   
   # with output
   anchor dummy-ops run greeter --workflow=good-manners-simulation
   ```

1. You are welcome to use other playground CLI commands and run different actions for checking different use cases

   | This is a quick overview just to get a grasp of how simple it is to use *anchor*.<br>To create your own remote marketplace, please [read here](docs/create-anchorfiles.md). |
